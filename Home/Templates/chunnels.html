            <h3>What are Chicken Tunnels?</h3>
            <p>Chicken tunnels, also known as chicken runs or chicken tractors, are portable enclosures that provide outdoor space for chickens to roam and forage while protecting them from predators. They allow chickens to graze on fresh grass and insects, improving their health and egg production.</p>
